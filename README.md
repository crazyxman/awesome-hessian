# Some suggestions
* **1，** It seems that the codes hosted in several websites and the version of code is too old .  We can host the codes here and maintain continuously
* **2，** Collect all repos about hessian and find the best code of every language
* **3，** Some code has been found to have multiple versions, maintained independently, somewhat fragmented, considered merging, and developed together.
